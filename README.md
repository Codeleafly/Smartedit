## üöÄ Key Features in Detail

### Intelligent Syntax Highlighting

![SmartEdit with JavaScript Syntax Highlighting](https://placehold.co/800x400/222B45/E2E8F0?text=SmartEdit+with+JavaScript+Syntax+Highlighting)

SmartEdit uses a sophisticated parsing engine to apply syntax highlighting on the fly. It supports a wide array of file types and is easily extensible. Keywords, comments, strings, and operators are rendered in distinct colors, drastically improving code readability and helping you identify errors more quickly. The current version includes support for:

* JavaScript (`.js`)
* HTML (`.html`)
* CSS (`.css`)
* JSON (`.json`)
* C++ (`.cpp`)
* Python (`.py`)

### Robust Editing & Navigation

SmartEdit offers a complete suite of editing tools, making it a true replacement for basic terminal editors.

* **Undo/Redo**: Our stack-based system captures every keystroke and action, allowing you to `Ctrl + Z` to revert changes and `Ctrl + Y` to reapply them. This provides an invaluable safety net for all your coding sessions.
* **Copy/Paste/Cut**: The editor provides standard `Ctrl + C`, `Ctrl + V`, and `Ctrl + X` shortcuts, which work with both single characters and multi-line text blocks.
* **Effortless Navigation**: In addition to standard arrow keys, you can jump to the beginning of a line with `Ctrl + A` and the end with `Ctrl + E`. `Page Up` and `Page Down` provide fast vertical scrolling for navigating large files.

### Adaptive and Clean Interface

![Responsive UI on a Smaller Terminal](https://placehold.co/800x400/334155/ffffff?text=Responsive+UI+on+a+Smaller+Terminal)

SmartEdit's UI is built on a responsive grid system. The moment you resize your terminal, the editor's display adapts in real-time. Line numbers, content, and the status bar are all dynamically adjusted to the new dimensions. This ensures that you get a clear, unobstructed view of your code, regardless of your terminal size.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

SmartEdit is published on the official NPM registry and can be easily installed with a single command.

### Installation

You can install SmartEdit globally on your system to make the `smartedit` command accessible from any directory.

```bash
# Global installation using npm
npm install -g smartedit
```

Alternatively, you can use `npx` to run SmartEdit without a global installation. This is useful for temporary use or in restricted environments.

```bash
# Run without installing using npx
npx smartedit
```

### Basic Usage

To open an existing file or create a new one, type `smartedit` followed by the filename.

```bash
# Open 'main.py' or create it if it doesn't exist
smartedit main.py

# Open a file with a full path
smartedit /home/user/projects/my-app/src/index.js
```

## üìú Detailed Code Documentation (A Deep Dive)

This section is for developers interested in the architecture and internal workings of SmartEdit. We will break down the key functions and how they contribute to the editor's overall functionality.

### Core Rendering Loop

The heart of SmartEdit is its rendering loop. It's a simple yet powerful design: on every key press, the editor's state is updated, the screen is cleared, and the UI is redrawn. This ensures that the display is always a perfect reflection of the current state.

#### `displayContent()`

**Purpose**: The central rendering function.

**Code Breakdown**:
1.  `clearScreen()` is called to reset the terminal.
2.  The file content (`lines` array) is iterated over.
3.  Each line is passed to `highlightContent()` for syntax highlighting.
4.  Line numbers are generated and displayed.
5.  `getVisualLineSegments()` is used to break up long lines for wrapping.
6.  The highlighted and wrapped content is printed to the terminal.
7.  Finally, the status bar is rendered, and the cursor is repositioned using `readline.cursorTo()` and `readline.moveCursor()` to the correct `(x, y)` coordinates.

#### `highlightContent(content, filename)`

**Purpose**: To apply syntax highlighting based on file type.

**Code Breakdown**: This function uses a series of regular expressions (e.g., for `/\b(const|let|var|function)\b/g` in JavaScript) to find language-specific tokens. It wraps these tokens with ANSI escape codes (`\x1b[33m` for yellow, `\x1b[36m` for cyan, etc.) from the `Colors` constant. The final output is a single string with embedded color codes.

#### `getVisualWidth(text)` and `getVisualLineSegments(...)`

**Purpose**: To handle the editor's responsive layout.

**Code Breakdown**:
* `getVisualWidth()` uses a regular expression to count the characters without including ANSI codes, providing the true on-screen width of a string.
* `getVisualLineSegments()` uses this width to intelligently wrap lines. It iterates through a line, adding words to a segment until the `availableWidth` is exceeded. It then starts a new segment, preventing text from spilling off-screen.
